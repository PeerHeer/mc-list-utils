# Call this function to compare the values in DataL and DataR.
# First checks if the data is exactly equal (equal type, equal value).
# If not, does comparison based on type.
# The result can be printed by setting #nbtcomp.print_result_toggle or #nbtcomp.print_result.
#
# The comparison result is returned in the #nbtcomp.compare.result nbtcomp.var score:
# + -1 if DataL is smaller than DataR
# + 0 if DataL and DataR both have the same value
# + 1 if DataR is smaller than DataL
# + 2 if DataL and DataR are incomparable

# Put the data in nbtcomp:compare storage.
data modify storage nbtcomp:compare Compare.DataL set from storage nbtcomp:input DataL

# Step 1: check if the values are exactly equal.

# If the data was not equal, start detecting the types of data. These types are used to determine how the data should be compared.
